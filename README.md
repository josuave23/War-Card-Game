# War Card Game Simulator
This program uses custom Card and Deck objects to simulate a game of War between two players

The program will shuffle the deck and deal cards to each of the players, then count the amount of wins, losses, and ties that happen until the entire deck is dealed.

# Possible next steps
-  Implement decks for each player, and allow the game to run until one player gets all the cards
-  Implement a "war" when there is a tie
